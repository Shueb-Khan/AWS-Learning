🔑 What Is IAM?
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.

👥 IAM User Groups
Purpose: A way to manage permissions for multiple users.
Benefits:
Assign policies to a group instead of each user.
Easier to organize by job roles (e.g., Admins, Developers).
🔧 Example:
Group: Developers
Members: Alice, Bob
Attached Policy: Full access to EC2
🧍 IAM Users
Definition: An individual identity with credentials.
Used for: Human access to AWS Console or CLI.
Has:
Username
Access key (for CLI/API)
Password (for Console)
🛠 Best Practice:
Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for increased security.

🎭 IAM Roles
Definition: A set of permissions that AWS services or users can assume temporarily.
Used For:
EC2 accessing S3
Cross-account access
AWS services assuming permissions
📌 Trust Relationship:
Defines who can assume the role.

📜 IAM Policies
Definition: A JSON document that defines permissions.
Attached To:
Users
Groups
Roles
✍️ Example Policy:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
