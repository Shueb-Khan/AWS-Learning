Welcome to my curated AWS learning roadmap, built to align with the AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) certification. Over the course of three months, I've explored key services and concepts that cloud engineers rely on to design, deploy, secure, and scale infrastructure on AWS. This repository breaks down my progress module-by-module—each section representing focused hands-on practice, written documentation, and conceptual understanding.

Understand AWS's core purpose and set up a secure account.

🛠️ Module 2: Compute & Deployment
✅ Topics:
EC2: Launch, configure, SSH into instances

IAM roles for EC2

Security Groups & Key Pairs

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

Intro to Auto Scaling

📌 Goal:
Run virtual servers with access control and scaling.

🗂️ Module 3: Storage Services
✅ Topics:

✅ Topics:
Permission boundaries

Policies (inline, managed, customer-managed)

Cross-account access

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

📌 Goal:
Master secure access control—key for client work & compliance.

📊 Module 6: Monitoring & Automation
✅ Topics:
CloudWatch (logs, metrics, alarms)

CloudTrail

AWS Config

CloudFormation (infrastructure as code)

📌 Goal:
Track, automate, and respond to changes efficiently.

🗄️ Module 7: Databases
✅ Topics:
Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Amazon DynamoDB

Backup, replication, failover

📌 Goal:
Host and manage data for dynamic apps.

💸 Module 8: Cost Optimization & Billing
