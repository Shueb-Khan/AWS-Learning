 1. Understand the Exam Blueprint:
Before you dive into studying, familiarize yourself with the high-level domains and their weightage. This helps you allocate study time proportionally.

• Design Secure Architectures (30%): Focuses on IAM, encryption, and security best practices. This domain tests your ability to restrict access, secure workloads, and implement data protection.

• Design Resilient Architectures (26%): Emphasizes fault tolerance, multi-AZ deployments, and decoupling mechanisms. You’ll need to plan for failure, use auto scaling, and design loosely coupled systems.

• Design High-Performing Architectures (24%): Covers performance optimization for compute, storage, database, and networking. This includes choosing the right instance types, caching strategies, and global acceleration.

• Design Cost-Optimized Architectures (20%): Assesses cost-control strategies such as RI, Savings Plans, and lifecycle policies. You must balance performance with budget constraints and use AWS cost management tools.


2. Build Your AWS Foundations
Solidify your understanding of core cloud concepts before diving into services.

2.1 Cloud Computing Models and AWS Global Infrastructure
• Cloud Service Models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) grants virtualized compute, storage, and networking. Platform as a Service (PaaS) abstracts the OS layer, letting you focus on applications. Software as a Service (SaaS) delivers fully managed end-user applications.

• AWS Global Infrastructure: AWS is divided into Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations for CDN services. Each Region contains multiple AZs for fault isolation and low-latency access.

2.2 Foundational Services
Familiarize yourself with these services which you’ll encounter throughout the exam:

3. Master Compute Services
Compute services provide the processing power for your applications. Understand when to use each.

3.1 Amazon EC2
• Instance Types & Pricing Models: General purpose (M, T families) vs. compute optimized (C), memory optimized (R), accelerated (P/G). On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Spot, Savings Plans, Dedicated Hosts. Choose instances based on workload requirements and cost profiles.

• Auto Scaling & Placement Groups: Use EC2 Auto Scaling for dynamic scaling based on demand. Placement groups (Cluster, Spread, Partition) optimize network latency and isolate failures.

• EBS & Instance Store: EBS-backed root volumes persist independently and support snapshotting. Instance Store is ephemeral but offers high IOPS—best for caches or scratch data.

3.2 AWS Lambda
• Serverless Model: Run code without managing servers; pay per execution; integrates with S3, DynamoDB, SQS etc. Understand cold starts, concurrency, and function limits.

• Event-Driven Architectures: Trigger Lambda from AWS services (CloudWatch Events, S3, Kinesis) or via API Gateway. Use Lambda Destinations and event mapping for asynchronous invocation.

3.3 Container Services
• Amazon ECS & Fargate: Docker-based orchestration with EC2 or Fargate launch types. Fargate abstracts server management; ECS on EC2 provides full control.

• Amazon EKS: Managed Kubernetes; decouple control plane management from your worker nodes. Integrates with IAM roles for pods and CloudWatch Container Insights.

4.2 Block & File Storage
• Amazon EBS: Persistent block storage; SSD vs. HDD volumes; Provisioned IOPS for high performance. Snapshots to S3, encryption at rest, resize volumes online.

2. Elimination Method • Narrow down answer choices by excluding clearly wrong options. • Focus on the “MOST cost-effective” or “LEAST operational overhead” qualifiers in questions.

3. Read Carefully • Pay attention to negative wording (“Which option is NOT…?”). • Watch for AWS service updates that affect answers (e.g., latest limits).

4. Use Your Scratch Sheet • Jot down domain weightage and key service limits (e.g., EC2 instance sizes, RTO/RPO figures).

5. Stay Calm and Focused • Take deep breaths if you feel nervous. • Remind yourself of your preparation and practice exam scores.
